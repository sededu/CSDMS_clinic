# CSDMS clinic

This repository houses materials used at the 2019 CSDMS annual meeting, in a clinic called "Developing and teaching interactive sedimentology and stratigraphy computer activities".

## Getting started before the clinic
Hi everyone, and thanks for signing up for my clinic! 
For some of the the clinic I will demonstrate and explain how these modules work and can be used in a classroom (lecture style).
However, I really want the session to be mostly interactive, which means you will need a laptop with the proper software installed.
We will spend the better part of the session with you coding on your laptops, creating your own module.

__Please__ see below for instructions on installing Python and testing your software before the clinic. 
This will help optimize our time together.

__If you don't have a laptop that is completely fine.__
You will be able to follow on with a partner and complete the work together. 
You will still learn how to create the modules! 

__All the materials will be made available online__, so you can access them on your own computer on your own time.


## Installing Python and running the modules

The development of these modules depends on Python 3, `tkinter`, and the Python packages `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `shapely`. 

### Installing Python 3

If you are new to Python, it is recommended that you install Anaconda, which is an open source distribution of Python which includes many basic scientific libraries, some of which are used in the module. 
If you already have Python and know how to use it, you can skip below to trying out the activity.
Anaconda can be downloaded at https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
If you do not have storage space on your machine for Anaconda or wish to install a smaller version of Python for another reason, see below on options for Miniconda or vanilla Python.

1. Visit the website for Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and select the installer for your operating system.
__Be sure to select the Python 3.x installation.__
2. Start the installer.
3. If prompted, select to "install just for me", unless you know what you are doing.
4. When prompted to add Anaconda to the path during installation, select _yes_ if you don't currently use Python for anything on your computer, otherwise select _no_.

### Installing the needed packages

To install the needed packages, we will use Anaconda:



_Note:_ if you wish to use `pip` instead, that should be fine. You can `pip install rivers2stratigraphy`.


## Clinic abstract

In this clinic, we will first demonstrate existing interactive computer-based activities used for teaching concepts in sedimentology and stratigraphy.
This will be followed by a hands-on session for creating different modules based on the participantsâ€™ teaching and research interests.
Active learning strategies improve student exam performance, engagement, attitudes, thinking, writing, self-reported participation and interest, and help students become better acquainted with one another (Prince, 2004).
Specifically, computer-based active learning is an attractive educational approach for post-secondary educators, because developing these activities takes advantage of existing knowledge and skills the educator is likely to already have.

The demonstration portion of the clinic will focus on the existing rivers2stratigraphy (https://github.com/sededu/rivers2stratigraphy) activity, which illustrates basin-scale development of fluvial stratigraphy through adjustments in system kinematics including sandy channel migration and subsidence rates.
The activity allows users to change these system properties, so as to drive changing depositional patterns.
The module utilizes a rules based model, which produces realistic channel patterns, but simplifies the simulation to run efficiently, in real-time.
The clinic will couple rivers2stratigraphy to a conventional laboratory activity which interprets an outcrop photograph of fluvial stratigraphy, and discuss logistics of using the module in the classroom.

For the second part of the clinic, familiarity with Python will be beneficial (but is not required); we will utilize existing graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks in developing new activities, aimed to provide a user-friendly means for students to interact with model codes while engaging in geological learning. 
Participants should plan to have Python installed on their personal computers prior to the workshop, and a sample module will be emailed beforehand to let participants begin exploring the syllabus.
