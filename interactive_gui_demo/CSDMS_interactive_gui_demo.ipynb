    "## A note on functional vs. object-oriented programming\n",
    "Python and matplotlib are designed to be object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. This differs from functional programming (FP, which is more common for scientists), and it is important to understand this approach in creating these modules. FP relies on functions which take \"data\" as an argument, and manipulate the data to return the modified data as a new set of data, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = [1,2,3]\n",
    "z_sum = sum(xz)\n",
    "\n",
    "z_sum\n",
    "    6\n",
    "```\n",
    "OOP relies on objects which themselves _are_ the data, and have their own _methods_ to manipulate themselves directly, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = vector([1,2,3])\n",
    "z.sum()\n",
    "    6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction may seem subtle, but it is important for creating these modules. The reason is that if we adhere to a FP approach, then we would create a new version of the \"data\" every time we want to update the plot in the module. Applied to our example of a sloping line, we don't want to create a new `x` and `y` and new line in the plot every time we update; instead, we want to change the values of the data (i.e., the values of the object) using the methods provided to us by OOP. Creating new lines every time would 1) clutter the plot and make it hard to read, and 2) take up more and more computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `z` is called an _instance_ of the _class_ `vector`, and we are calling its _method_ `sum`. These terms will be useful when discussing the creation of a module. In matplotlib parlance, the _figure_ refers to the overall object, and the _axes_ refers to the items within that figure. Examples of axes could be a plot with lines, or a slider. "
